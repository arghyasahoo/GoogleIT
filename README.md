This is a handy little tool for lazyass people like me to google stuff faster

Often times you want to google something super fast and you don't have the patience to wait until your browser opens up. This tool puts an end to all your worries. Open up a window on a key combo and search what you want. Your browser will open up in the background ready with the results.

**Key-Combo**: Ctrl+Shift+X


## N.B.
Install **Konqueror** browser beforehand if you are using *KDE* Desktop Environment
